Jetbot Road Detect Project

1. Scraping
    image datasets from 
    https://www.freepik.com/
    https://www.cognata.com/
    https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~grauman/courses/spring2008/datasets.htm

    scrap images about STOP sign, crosswalk etc
    for more precise detecting, scrap images more than 1,000

2. Machine Learning, Detecting
    detect road line and signs, use OPENCV
    if detects signs or obstacles, stop and make detour(우회)

3. Jetbot
    use jetbot camera, detect road and signs
    moving motions(forward, stop, detour)
